## Typing 20 words TIME TRIAL

I really had fun developing this short project, as you can see my purpose with this project was not to make it pretty, but to make it functional. I developed this project because I got a new computer and wanted to get used to the new keyboard.

My next project will be focused almost completely on making it pretty, using clean architecture and trying something that I have never tried before... I don't want to spoil you guys! So you will see what I am talking about soon... I am sure that the next project will be useful for a lot of people.

For now, have fun seeing how fast you can type 20 words!
